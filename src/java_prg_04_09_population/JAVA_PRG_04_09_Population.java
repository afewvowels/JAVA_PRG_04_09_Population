/**
 *
 * @author bluebackdev
 * Write a program that will predict the size of a population of organisms. The
 * program should ask for the starting number of organisms, their average
 * daily population increase (as a percentage), and the number of days they will
 * multiply. For example, a population might begin with two organisms, have an
 * average daily increase of 50 percent, and will be allowed to multiply for
 * seven days. The program should use a loop to display the size of the
 * population for each day.
 * 
 * Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 2 for the starting size
 * of the population. Do not accept a negative number for average daily population
 * increase. Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days they
 * will multiply.
